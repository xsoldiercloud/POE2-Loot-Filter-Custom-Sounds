# Loot Filter Customizer

This tool allows you to update the sound rules for Divine Orbs and Exalted Orbs in an **unmodified Neversink loot filter**. The tool modifies the `.filter` file and copies the associated `.ogg` sound file to the correct location.

## How to Use

### 1. **Preparation**
- **Ensure You Are Using an Unmodified Neversink Filter**:
  - The tool is designed to work specifically with a raw, unmodified version of Neversink's loot filter. Filters that have already been customized may not work correctly.
- **Place the Filter in the Correct Folder**:
  - Copy the `.filter` file to your Path of Exile filter folder before using the tool:
    ```
    Documents\My Games\Path of Exile
    ```
- **Provide Your Own `.ogg` Files**:
  - You must supply the `.ogg` sound files you wish to use for the Divine Orbs and Exalted Orbs.

---

### 2. **Running the Tool**
1. Launch the executable.
2. Browse for the `.filter` file you want to update.
3. Select an `.ogg` sound file for the new sound.
4. Choose whether to update Divine Orb or Exalted Orb rules.

---

### 3. **What the Tool Does**
- The tool creates an updated `.filter` file with the selected sound rules.
- It also copies the `.ogg` sound file to the same folder as the `.filter` file.

---

## Important Notes
- **File Placement**:
  - The `.ogg` sound file must be in the same directory as the `.filter` file for the game to recognize it.
  - If you try to update the filter from a location like the Desktop:
    - The updated `.filter` file will be created on the Desktop.
    - The `.ogg` file will also be copied to the Desktop.
    - You must **manually move both files** to your Path of Exile filter folder.

- **Compatibility**:
  - This tool only works with **unmodified Neversink filters**. Using it on already-modified filters will lead to unexpected results.

## Example Workflow
1. Download the raw version of Neversink's loot filter.
2. Copy the `.filter` file to:
   ```
   Documents\My Games\Path of Exile
   ```
3. Run the tool and select the `.filter` file from this folder.
4. Choose an `.ogg` sound file and update the filter.
5. Verify that the updated `.filter` file and `.ogg` file are in the Path of Exile filter folder.
6. Refresh the loot filter list in Path of Exile and select the updated filter.
